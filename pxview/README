What is pxview ?
----------------

pxview is a quite simple command line program which has been originally
created to test pxlib. pxlib is a library to read Paradox files.
During the development pxview has evolved more and more into a useful
program to examine the contents of Paradox files and to convert them
into SQL or CSV format.

At the current stage it can not read all of the different Paradox
files but it is quite good at reading .DB files.

For a more detailed documentation read the man page pxview(1) and
check the web site at http://pxlib.sourceforge.net.
